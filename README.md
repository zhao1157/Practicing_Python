# Python
## ========== 1. Learning_Python/Learning_python.py
### My learning philosophy: 
1. Practice the syntax of the new language and test my understanding of it by putting it into various situations; 
2. Integrate what I have leant with the new piece I'm learning to improve my understanding and view of the new language; 
3. Compare with other languages I have learnt and try to solve some similar problems encountered before with the new language.

### My goals: 
1. Be familiar with and  master the new language; 
2. Through writing codes and testing of them, take good notes of the new language; 
3. Form my own syntax library of the new language for future review.

This script is to finally generate fine mesh for each transition, which is used in FAC calculation. See the awk-scripts needed before
executing this python script in my repository Gawk/Create_Fine_Mesh/{\*}.
