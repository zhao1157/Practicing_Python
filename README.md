# Python
## ========== 1. Learning_Python/Learning_python.py
### My learning philosophy: 
1. Practice the syntax of the new language and test my understanding of it by putting it into various situations; 
2. Integrate what I have leant with the new piece I'm learning to improve my understanding and view of the new language; 
3. Compare with other languages I have learnt and try to solve some similar problems encountered before with the new language.

### My goals: 
1. Be familiar with and  master the new language; 
2. Through writing codes and testing of them, take good notes of the new language; 
3. Form my own syntax library of the new language for future review.

## ========== 2. Create_Fine_Mesh/creat_fine_mesh_5.py
This script is to finally generate fine mesh for each transition, which is used in FAC calculation. See the awk-scripts needed before
executing this python script in my repository Gawk/Create_Fine_Mesh/{\*}.

*** 

## ========== 3. Generate_PIX/{\*}
This script is the core part of generating photoionization cross section data. The rest of codes can be found in the folder of the same
name in repositories Bash and Gawk.

***

## ========== 4. Extract_Energy_Mesh/{\*}
This script is to extract the energy mesh in RM calculation, for later use in FAC.

***

## ========== 5. Generate_FAC_Mesh_454/{\*}
Along with other codes in Generate_FAC_Mesh_454/ in repositories C & Python, these scripts are used to generate the FAC energy mesh for
454 levels.

***
## ========== 6. Generate_FAC_Mesh_454/{\*}
Along with other codes in Generate_FAC_Mesh_454/ in repositories Bash & C, this program is used to generate the FAC energy mesh for
454 levels.

***
## ========== 7. Fe XVIII/{\*}
In this directory, you will find the python scripts I used to run the large number of PBS jobs on cluster nodes, to combine the small
section data into a whole set of data, to plot all the data in one go. You can also see a sample of plots I did.
